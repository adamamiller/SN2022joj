\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}
\subsection{Optical Photometry}
\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{photometry.pdf}
    \label{fig:lc}
    \caption{Comparison of the photometric properties of \sn\ with those of ZTF18abauprj (99aa-/91T-like SN) and SN\,2013bh (00cx-like SN). \textit{Left}: multiband light curves. The upper (lower) panel shows the evolution in the $g$-band ($r$-band) absolute magnitude. %{The arrows mark the 5$\sigma$ limit of the last nondetections of \sn\ in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ and $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$.} 
    \textit{Right}: $g-r$ color evolution. %For each object, the peak epoch is marked by a vertical line with the corresponding color on the bottom axis. 
    The gray circles denote the $g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color evolution of 12 nearby ($z\le0.05$) normal SNe\,Ia (open circles) from the ZTF sample with prompt observations within 5\,days of first light \citep{Bulla2020}.}

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy}\label{sec:optical_spec}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{SN2022joj_spectral_sequence.pdf}
    \caption{Optical spectral sequence of \sn. Rest-frame phases (days) relative to the $B$-band peak and instruments used are posted next to each spectrum. Spectra have been corrected for $E(B-V)_\mathrm{MW} = 0.04$\,mag and are shown in gray. The black lines are binned spectra with a bin size of 10\,\AA, except for the SEDM spectra, whose resolution is lower than the bin size. The corresponding wavelengths of the \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 line (with an expansion velocity of 10,000\,\kms) and the \ion{Ca}{2} IRT (with expansion velocities of both 10,000\,\kms and 25,000\,\kms) are marked by the vertical dashed lines.}

\subsection{Models} \label{sec:model}

    \label{fig:model_spec}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Nebular-phase Spectra}
\begin{itemize}
    \item weak emission in the 7300 complex compared to normal SNe\,Ia -- similar to 91T-like events
    \item Blueshifted [\ion{Fe}{2}] 7300 features ($\sim$$-2.21\pm0.33\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ in the Binospec spectrum; $\sim$$-1.24\pm0.42\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ in the LRIS spectrum), consistent with low-\ion{Si}{2}-velocity SNe Ia
    \item No evidence for [\ion{Ni}{2}] $\lambda\lambda$7378, 7412 or [\ion{Ca}{2}] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7323 -- 3-$\sigma$ upper limit for $M_\mathrm{Fe}/M_\mathrm{Ni}$ is 0.05 (techniques adopted from \citet{Maguire_2018}), consistent with sub-\Mch\ DDet scenario?
\end{itemize}

% This work is based on observations obtained with the Samuel Oschin Telescope 48-inch and the 60-inch Telescope at the Palomar Observatory as part of the Zwicky Transient Facility project. ZTF is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. AST-1440341 and a collaboration including Caltech, IPAC, the Weizmann Institute of Science, the Oskar Klein Center at Stockholm University, the University of Maryland, the University of Washington, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron and Humboldt University, Los Alamos National Laboratories, the TANGO Consortium of Taiwan, the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. Operations are conducted by COO, IPAC, and UW. 
% SED Machine is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.\ 1106171.

% This work is also based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, owned in collaboration by the University of Turku and Aarhus University, and operated jointly by Aarhus University, the University of Turku and the University of Oslo, representing Denmark, Finland and Norway, the University of Iceland and Stockholm University at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain, of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.

% A major upgrade of the Kast spectrograph on the Shane 3\,m telescope at Lick Observatory, led by Brad Holden, was made possible through gifts from the Heising-Simons Foundation, William and Marina Kast, and the University of California Observatories. Research at Lick Observatory is partially supported by a generous gift from Google. The W. M. Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and NASA; the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. {W. M. Keck Observatory access was supported by Northwestern University and the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA).}
