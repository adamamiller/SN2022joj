\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}
\subsection{Discovery \& Classification}
\sn\ was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility \citep[ZTF;][]{Bellm_ZTF_2019a,Graham_ZTF_2019,Dekany_ZTF_2020} on 2022 May 08.298 (UT dates are used throughout the paper; MJD 59707.298) with the 48\,inch Samuel Oschin Telescope (P48) at Palomar Observatory. It was detected with $r_\mathrm{ZTF}=19.13\pm0.06$\,mag at $\alpha_\mathrm{J2000}=14^\mathrm{h}41^\mathrm{m}40\fs08$, $\delta_\mathrm{J2000}=+03\degr00'24\farcs{14}$ and announced to the public by \citet{Fremling_2022TNSTR}. The detection was made by the automatic ZTF discovery pipeline \citep{Masci_ZTF_2019} with the image differencing technique \citep{Zackay_imagesub_2016}. A real-time alert \citep{Patterson_ZTFalert_2019} was generated as the candidate passed internal machine-learning thresholds \citep[e.g.,][]{Duev_ZTFML_2019,Mahabal_ZTFML_2019}, and an internal designation ZTF22aajijjf was assigned. The last 3-$\sigma$ nondetection limits the brightness to $r_\mathrm{ZTF}>21.48$\,mag on 2022 May 03.27 (MJD 59702.27; 5.03\,days before the first detection).

The first spectrum was obtained on 2022 May 11.288 by \citet{Newsome_2022TNSCR}, who found a best fit to a young Type I SN at $z=0.03$ using the \texttt{Supernova Identification (SNID)} code \citep{Blondin_SNID_2007}. The prominent \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 and \ion{Ca}{2} infrared triplet (IRT) absorption features point to a SN Ia, while the blue side of the spectrum ($\lesssim$5000\,\r{A}) is strongly suppressed (see Figure~\ref{fig:spec_seq}), atypical for a normal SN\,Ia at a similar phase. It was indisputably classified as a SN\,Ia by \citet{Chu_2022TNSCR} at its maximum luminosity based on its blue color and persistent \ion{Si}{2} features.

\subsection{Host Galaxy}
The host of \sn\ is a dwarf galaxy at $\alpha_\mathrm{J2000}=14^\mathrm{h}41^\mathrm{m}40\fs04$, $\delta_\mathrm{J2000}=+03\degr00'24\farcs{53}$, cataloged in the DESI Legacy Survey \citep[LS;][]{Dey_LS_2019}. \sn\ has a projected offset of only $0\farcs{5}$ to the host. On 2023 April 26, we took a spectrum of both the SN and the host using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I 10m telescope \citep{Keck_1995}. We placed the slit across both the center of the galaxy and the position of the SN (Figure~\ref{fig:host_spec}), with a total integration time of 3600\,s. The spectrum was reduced with the \texttt{PypeIt} package \citep{pypeit:joss_pub}. While the continuum spectrum of the host was still outshined by the SN, we detected a potential host emission line at 6742.4\,\r{A} with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of $\sim$5. If this is associated with the H$\alpha$ emission, the corresponding redshift of the host galaxy is $z=0.02736$, which is in general agreement with the estimated value $z=0.03$ by matching the SN spectra to \texttt{SNID} templates \citep{Newsome_2022TNSCR}. In the 2D spectrum (Figure~\ref{fig:host_spec}), the trace is dominated by the light of the SN in the nebular phase, while the center of this emission feature has a offset of $\sim$3--4 pixels to the center of the trace. The CCDs equipped on LRIS have a pixel scale of $0\farcs135$/pixel, so this offset corresponds to an angular offset of $\sim$$0\farcs4$--$0\farcs5$, consistent with the archival value. This indicates that the H$\alpha$ detection should not be an artifact.

We estimate the distance modulus of \sn\ in the following way. We first use the 2M++ model \citep{Carrick2015_2M++} to estimate the peculiar velocity of the host galaxy to be $383\pm250$\,\kms. Then the peculiar velocity is combined with the recession velocity in the frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) $v_\mathrm{CMB}=8424$\,\kms, which yields a net Hubble recession rate of $8193\pm250$\,\kms. Using cosmological parameters $H_0 = 70\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $\Omega_M=0.3$, and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, the estimated luminosity distance to \sn\ is 119.5\,Mpc, equivalent to a distance modulus of $35.39\pm0.03$\,mag.

\subsection{Optical Photometry}
\sn\ was monitored in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$, $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$, and $i_\mathrm{ZTF}$ by ZTF as part of its ongoing Northern Sky Survey \citep{Bellm_ZTF_2019b}, while the $i_\mathrm{ZTF}$ data only cover the decline from the peak. We adopt a Galactic extinction of $E(B-V)_\mathrm{MW}=0.032$\,mag \citep{Schlafly2011}, and correct all photometry using the extinction model from \citet{Fitzpatrick1999} assuming $R_V=3.1$. We do not find any \ion{Na}{1} D absorption at the redshift of the host galaxy, indicating that the extinction from the host is negligible. The blue $g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color ($\sim$$-0.2$\,mag) near maximum luminosity after correcting for the Galactic extinction is also consistent with no additional reddening from the host. Therefore we assume $E(B-V)_\mathrm{host}=0$.

The basic photometric properties of \sn\ are listed in Table~\ref{tab:basics}. We do not include the maximum $i_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band properties, which are relatively uncertain due to the low cadance in $i_\mathrm{ZTF}$ around peak. 
The forced-photometry light curves\footnote{\url{https://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/ztf/forcedphot.pdf}} in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ and $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ (in absolute magnitudes) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lc}. These light curves are reduced using the pipeline from A. A. Miller et al. (2023, in preparation); see also \citet{Yao_2019}.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy}\label{sec:optical_spec}

We obtained a series of optical spectra of \sn\ using the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine \citep[SEDM;][]{SEDM_2018} on the automated 60\,inch telescope \citep[P60;][]{P60_2006} at Palomar observatory, the Andalucia Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC)\footnote{\url{http://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/}} installed at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), the SPectrograph for the Rapid Acquisition of Transients \citep[SPRAT;][]{SPRAT_2014} on the 2\,m Liverpool Telescope \citep[LT;][]{LT_2004}, FLOYDS spectrograph\footnote{\url{https://lco.global/observatory/instruments/floyds/}} on the 2m Faulkes Telescope South (FTS) at Siding Spring as part of the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope (LCOGT) network \citep{LCOGT_2013}, Binospec \citep{Binospec_2019} on the 6.5m MMT telescope, and LRIS on the Keck I 10m telescope \citep{Keck_1995}. With the exception of observations obtained with SEDM, all spectra were reduced using standard procedures \citep[e.g.,][]{Matheson_2000}. The SEDM spectra were reduced using the custom \texttt{pysedm} software package \citep{Rigault_pysedm_2019}. Details of the spectroscopic observations are listed in Table~\ref{tab:spec}. The resulting spectral sequence is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:spec_seq}. All the spectra listed in Table 1 will be available on WISeREP \citep{wiserep_2012}.

We also include the spectrum uploaded to the Transient Name Server (TNS) by \citet{Newsome_2022TNSCR} in our analysis, which was obtained using the FLOYDS spectrograph on the 2m Faulkes Telescope North (FTN) at Haleakala.

\section{Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}
\subsection{Early Light Curves and the First Light}
To estimate the time of first light ($t_\mathrm{fl}$), we follow the convention \citep[e.g.,][]{Miller_ZTF_2020} by assuming a power-law rise in the broad-band flux $f(t)$,
$$
f(t) = A (t-t_\mathrm{fl})^\alpha,
$$
where $A$ is a constant amplitude and $\alpha$ is the power-law index. In practice we only fit the $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band forced-photometry light curve, since we do not have any early detection in $i_\mathrm{ZTF}$, and the $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band flux is strongly suppressed at the early phase (see Section~\ref{sec:analysis_phot}). We estimate $\alpha$, $t_\mathrm{fl}$, and $\ln A$ in a Bayesian approach by sampling their posterior distributions with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using the package \texttt{PyMC} \citep{pymc_2016}. We find that the $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band light curve is consistent with a power-law rise with $\alpha=2.32^{+0.23}_{-0.29}$, in which the first detection in $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ is $4.55^{+0.86}_{-0.67}$\,days after the first light. This estimate is still consistent with the $\alpha=2$ fireball model. When fixing $\alpha=2$, the model still fits the light curve well, but the estimated $t_\mathrm{fl}$ is $\sim$1\,day later (see Table~\ref{tab:basics}). We do not find any correlated residuals as evidence for a flux excess in $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ after $\sim$5\,days since $t_\mathrm{fl}$, although a flux excess before the first detection could not be ruled out.


\subsection{Photometric Properties} \label{sec:analysis_phot}
\sn\ shows a few peculiar photometric features compared to normal SNe\,Ia. In Figure~\ref{fig:lc}, we compare the $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$, $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ light curves and the $g_\mathrm{ZTF} - r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color evolution of \sn\ with those of the well-observed normal SN\,Ia, SN\,2011fe,\footnote{we adopt the synthetic photometry in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ and $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ calculated using the spectrophotometric sequence from \citet{Pereira_2013}} as well as SN\,2018cnw (ZTF18abauprj) and SN\,2018cuw (ZTF18abcflnz) from a sample of SNe\,Ia with prompt observations within 5\,days of first light by ZTF \citep{Yao_2019,Bulla2020}. 
SN\,2018cnw is an overluminous SN\,Ia that falls into the category of SN\,1999aa-like \citep[99aa-like;][]{Garavini_99aa_2004} or SN\,1991T-like \citep[91T-like;][]{Filippenko_91T_1992} objects, while SN\,2018cuw is a normal SN\,Ia with a red $g_\mathrm{ZTF} - r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color comparable to that of \sn\ at early time. 

Around maximum brightness, \sn\ is overluminous, comparable to SN\,2018cnw, and $\sim$0.5\,mag brighter than SN\,2011fe in both $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ and $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$. But \sn\ clearly stands out due to its fast evolution in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$. While \sn\ and SN\,2018cnw show a similar maximum brightness in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$, upon the earliest detection in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ at $\sim$$-13$\,days, the corresponding absolute magnitude ($-17.2$\,mag) is $\sim$0.8\,mag fainter than that of SN\,2018cnw at a similar phase. This means on average, \sn\ rises faster than SN\,2018cnw by $\sim$$0.06\,\mathrm{mag\,day^{-1}}$ in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ during that period of time. On the decline, the $\Delta m_{15}(g_\mathrm{ZTF})$ of \sn\ is $\sim$1.2\,mag, which is significantly greater than that of the overluminous SN\,2018cnw ($\Delta m_{15}(g_\mathrm{ZTF})\simeq0.7$\,mag) or normal SN\,2011fe ($\Delta m_{15}(g_\mathrm{ZTF})\simeq0.8$\,mag). This is atypical for overluminous SNe\,Ia, which are among the slowest decliners in the SN\,Ia population \citep{Phillips_1999, Taubenberger_2017}. Such a rapid decline is probably due to a quickly developing exotic absorption feature near 4200\,\r{A} (see Section~\ref{sec:analysis_spec}). In $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ its behavior near maximum is generally similar to other SNe\,Ia, although the evolution still appears slightly faster.

The trail of \sn\ on the color evolution diagram does not overlap with any normal SNe\,Ia, as shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:lc}. We overplot 14 nearby ($z\lesssim0.05$) normal and 99aa-/91T-like SNe\,Ia from the ZTF early Ia sample \citep{Bulla2020}. They are corrected for Galactic extinction, but $K$-corrections have not been performed for consistency. Given the indisputable photometric and spectroscopic peculiarities in \sn, we do not expect any softwares trained on samples of normal SNe\,Ia would be able to estimate its $K$-correction correctly. Nevertheless, given its relatively low redshift ($z\lesssim0.03$), the $K$-correction is not expected to be huge. For the same reason we only include a subset of low-redshift SNe\,Ia from the sample of \citet{Bulla2020}. \sn\ is remarkably red ($g_\mathrm{ZTF} - r_\mathrm{ZTF}\simeq0.4$\,mag) around $\sim$7\,days after $t_\mathrm{fl}$, and is clearly an outlier compared to the normal Ia sample. In the following week, \sn\ quickly turns into blue, and is among the bluest objects in the sample $\sim$15\,days after $t_\mathrm{fl}$. SN\,2018cuw has a comparable $g_\mathrm{ZTF} - r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color at early times, but shows a much slower blueward evolution afterwards. From $\sim$10--20\,days after \tfl, before its reaches maximum brightness, \sn\ starts to evolve redward in the next $\sim$2\,months, qualitatively similar to other SNe\,Ia. While the overall trend resembles that of other SNe\,Ia, the turning point comes $\sim$20\,days earlier. Due to its rapid decay in $g_\mathrm{ZTF}$ after maximum brightness, it appears redder than the normal SN\,2011fe, the overluminous SN\,2018cnw, and the early-red object SN\,2018cuw $\sim$30--40\,days after \tfl. When $g_\mathrm{ZTF} - r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ reaches maximum ($\sim$0.8\,mag), \sn\ is again bluer than most of the SNe\,Ia in the ZTF sample. Eventually as \sn\ steps into the transitional phase, its color evolution follows the Lira law\footnote{The original Lira law was discovered in $B-V$ color. But in the $g_\mathrm{ZTF}-r_\mathrm{ZTF}$ color we see a similar trend.} \citep{Lira_1996,Phillips_1999} and shows no significant difference from that of SNe\,Ia.

To conclude, despite of its similarity in luminosity and color to 99aa-like/91T-like events at maximum brightness, the rapid rise and decline in light curves and the bizarre color evolution both indicate that \sn\ exhibits much more peculiarities compared to normal SNe\,Ia.

We obtain the spectra of these SNe\,Ia from \citet{Matheson_cfaIa_2008} (SN\,1999by) and \citet{Silverman_UCBIa_2012} (SN\,1991T, SN\,1999aa, and SN\,2000cx) except for SN\,2018aoz, whose spectra are obtained from \citet{Ni_18aoz_2023}.}

    \label{fig:phase_space}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:spec_seq}, we show the optical spectral sequence of \sn. The earliest spectrum obtained by \citet{Newsome_2022TNSCR} $\sim$$12$\,days before maximum brightness exhibits prominent absorption lines associated with \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 and \ion{Ca}{2} IRT. It also shows a strong suppression of flux blueward of $\sim$5000\,\r{A}, which accounts for the unusually red color of \sn\ at early times. Near maximum brightness, the two SEDM spectra show a very blue continuum between $\sim$5000--8000\,\r{A} with shallow absorption features, indicating a high photometric temperature. \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda\lambda$5972, 6355 lines, the \ion{S}{2} W-trough, and \ion{Ca}{2} IRT are detectable but not prominent. A wide, asymmetric absorption feature appears between $\sim$4000--4500\,\r{A} (the 4200\,\r{A} features hereafter). There is a break on the blue edge of this feature which could be associated with \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$4128 that is widely seen in other SNe\,Ia. However, the spectra of most of the normal and overluminous 99aa-like/91T-like SNe\,Ia show another peak at $\sim$4100--4200\,\r{A} redward of a narrow \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$4128 feature, which is absent in the spectra of \sn. The 4200\,\r{A} features become even wider and deeper in the ALFOSC spectrum at $\sim$$+9$\,days. Weeks after the maximum, in the FLOYDS spectrum ($+29$\,days) and the LRIS spectrum ($+36$\,days), the bottom of the 4200\,\r{A} features becomes flat, reminiscent of the Ti-trough in the subluminous SN\,1991bg-like \citep[91bg-like;][]{Filippenko_91bg_1992,Leibundgut_91bg_1993}. The nebular-phase spectra are dominated by [\ion{Fe}{2}], [\ion{Fe}{3}], and [\ion{Co}{3}] emission lines, but the [\ion{Fe}{2}] features (e.g, the complex around $\sim$7300\,\r{A}) appear weaker than those in other SNe\,Ia, probably suggesting a high ionization in the ejecta. We will discuss the late-time spectra of \sn\ in detail in Section~\ref{sec:disc_nebular}.

% 4200 A
In Figure~\ref{fig:spec_comp}, we compare the optical spectra of \sn\ to those of some other SNe\,Ia during photospheric and transitional phases. Near peak, the blue continuum in the spectrum of \sn\ and shallow absorption lines are both similar to those of overluminous objects, including SN\,1991T, SN\,1999aa, and SN\,2000cx. The asymmetric 4200\,\r{A} features are not seen in SN\,1991T or SN\,1999aa, while in SN\,2000cx, a similar (but narrower) absorption feature is interpreted as high velocity \ion{Ti}{2} \citep{Branch_00cx_2004}. The 4200\,\r{A} features are actually much more similar to the well-known Ti-trough that is ubiquitous in subluminous 91bg-like objects, e.g., SN\,1999by \citep{Arbour_1999}. Prior to the peak, SN\,1999by also shows this asymmetric absorption at about the same wavelength. A week after the maximum, this absorption feature has been widen and appears as a flat trough, which results from a blend of multiple IGEs dominated by \ion{Ti}{2} \citep{Filippenko_91bg_1992,Mazzali_1997}. It remains prominent in the spectrum a month after the maximum. Similarly, we find that this trough is prominent in the spectra of \sn\ at $+29$\,days and $+36$\,days. Other normal/overluminous SNe\,Ia, unlike \sn, all exhibit a dip around $\sim$4500\,\r{A}. Nevertheless, aside from the 4200\,\r{A} features, \sn\ is by no means similar to 91bg-like objects, which are $\gtrsim$2\,mag fainter at peak and exhibit much stronger \ion{Si}{2}, \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{O}{1} from a cooler line-forming region \citep{Filippenko_91bg_1992}. Ironically, the Ti-trough is also interpreted as a result of a low photospheric temperature \citep{Mazzali_1997}. Whether the 4200\,\r{A} features in \sn\ are dominated by \ion{Ti}{2} remains to be questioned.

% shallow silicon
\sn\ also shows remarkably shallow \ion{Si}{2} absorption at maximum brightness. Following the techniques elaborated in \citet{Liu_20jgb_2023}, we fit the \ion{Si}{2} features with multiple Gaussian profiles. In Table~\ref{tab:vel_EW} we list the estimates of the expansion velocities and the pseudo-equivalent widths ($p$EWs) of the major absorption lines from $\sim$$-12$\,days to $\sim$$+9$\,days. In Figure~\ref{fig:phase_space} we show the maximum brightness in $B$ and properties of the \ion{Si}{2} features for \sn, compared to those of a sample of normal SNe\,Ia from \citet{Zheng_2018} and \citet{Burrow_2020}. This plot again shows that \sn\ is slightly overluminous and has a relatively low expansion velocity measured with the \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 line (hereafter $v_\mathrm{Si}$). The $p$EWs in both \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 and \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 lines in \sn\ are lower than most of the normal SNe\,Ia, placing \sn\ to an extreme of the shallow-silicon group proposed in \citet{Branch_2006}, which mainly consists of overluminous 91T-like/99aa-like objects. This is consistent with the high luminosity and the blue color of \sn, since a high photometric temperature promotes the average ionization level of Si, reducing the abundance of singly ionized atoms. Interestingly, the $p$EW of \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 near peak is significantly lower than that in the first spectrum. In typical 91T-like/99aa-like objects, the \ion{Si}{2} features are relatively weak or even undetectable at early times, when the ejecta are even hotter, and only start to emerge around maximum light \citep{Filippenko_91T_1992}. In the early spectrum of \sn, in contrast, stronger absorption features from singly charged Si and Ca indicate a cooler line-forming region at early time compared to that near maximum brightness. 

In conclusion, the spectral evolution of \sn\ shows some similarities to those of 91T-like/99aa-like objects, as well as exotic peculiarities. A reasonable explosion model need to reproduce (i) strong suppression in flux blueward of $\sim$5000\,\r{A} at early times, and a rapid blueward evolution afterwards; (ii) the seemingly contradictory observables at peak, namely the tentative \ion{Ti}{2} features and the blue continuum/shallow \ion{Si}{2} feature at maximum, which usually indicate low and high photometric temperatures, respectively.

SNe\,Ia are generally expected to show a blue color shortly after its explosion when the hot ejecta have not yet cooled down. In addition, when there is an external energy source (e.g., shocks), the SN can show an excess in flux in the early light curves that appears even bluer. A non-negligible fraction of SNe\,Ia exhibit a blue flux excess \citep{Deckers_2022} Interactions of the ejecta with either a non-degenerate companion star \citep{Cao_14atg_2015,Marion_12cg_2016,Hosseinzadeh_17cbv_2017} or some dense circumstellar material \citep{Jiang_20hvf_2021,Dimitriadis_21zny_2023} could produce such a flux excess during shock cooling. Other scenarios include the presence of $^{56}$Ni in the outermost ejecta due to mixing \citep{Piro_2013,Magee_2020}, or as the products in the detonation of a helium shell \citep{polin_observational_2019}. 

However, there are not many scenarios that could possibly lead to a red color in the early light curve of a SN\,Ia when the ejecta are still hot and dense, as is the case of \sn. If the $^{56}$Ni synthesized at the center of the WD is not mixed with the outer layers and remains confined, the outer ejecta, where the $^{56}$Ni heating has yet to reach, will quickly cool down as they expand adiabatically at early times \citep{Piro_2016}. In the model with no $^{56}$Ni in \citet{Piro_2016}, for the $\sim$6\,days after the explosion the SN is expected to show an extremely red $B-V$ color (see their Figure~8), before the photosphere moves in to where the ejecta have been significant heated up by $^{56}$Ni. However, models with different degrees of mixing appear similar after the first $\sim$6\,days. In addition, models with a low degree of mixing are expected to have a ``dark phase'' \citep{Piro_2013} between the explosion and the first light of $\sim$1--5\,days, which roughly accounts for the escaping timescale of the photons emitted by the $^{56}$Ni underneath through diffusion. If the progenitor of \sn\ really has an extremely confined $^{56}$Ni distribution, then when we had our first color measurement $\sim$7\,days after \tfl, the time since the explosion could be even longer, say, $\sim$10\,days. At this phase, even the model with the most confined $^{56}$Ni distribution in \citet{Piro_2016} has turned into a normal blue color, while we still see an unusually red color in \sn. On the other hand, it has also been shown in \citet{Piro_2016} that the early light curves of the normal object SN\,2011fe is consistent with a non-negligible level of $^{56}$Ni mixing in the ejecta. It remains to be questioned whether there is an explosion scenario in which $^{56}$Ni does not get mixed at all.

Alternatively, in the DDet scenario, a layer of iron-group elements (IGEs) in the ashes of the helium shell can blanket the UV photons from the bulk ejecta, causing a red color \citep{polin_observational_2019}. This scenario has been proposed for a few archived objects with a red flux excess in their early light curves, including SN\,2016jhr \citep{jiang_16jhr_2017} and SN\,2018aoz \citep{Ni_2022}. In Figure~\ref{fig:model_spec} we compare the spectra of \sn\ at $\sim$$-12$\,days and near the maximum with those of DDet models in \citet{polin_observational_2019} and \citet{Shen_2D_2021}. Models from \citet{polin_observational_2019} are based on 1D hydrodynamical simulations, while 2D simulations are performed in models from \citet{Shen_2D_2021}. To create synthetic spectra, both models use the multi-dimensional radiative transfer \texttt{Sedona} code assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE). We refer to them as 1D models and 2D models hereafter, respectively. 

In the 1D models, the prime model parameters are the mass of the C/O core ($M_c$) and the mass of the helium shell ($M_s$). The maximum luminosity depends on the amount of $^{56}$Ni synthesized in the explosion, which is essentially determined by the total progenitor mass ($M_c+M_s$) in 1D models \citep{polin_observational_2019}. We find that the maximum brightness in $B$ ($M_{B,\mathrm{max}}=-19.82$\,mag) is reproduced by the 1D models with relatively massive progenitors ($\sim$1.2\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$). However, models with such massive progenitors tend to produce blue, featureless spectra at early times (e.g., the $M_c=1.1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, $M_s=0.05\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ model in Figure~\ref{fig:model_spec}), inconsistent with the observations. Less massive models could reproduce the line-blanketing features in the early spectra, but fail to reproduce the maximum brightness as well as the 4300\,\r{A} features in the observed spectra. In addition, all these 1D models overestimate the strength and the expansion velocity of the \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355 line at peak.

The tension in the line strengths and velocities can be mitigated by accounting for viewing angle effects in multi-dimensional models. In Figure~\ref{fig:phase_space} we overplot the properties of a few 2D DDet models from \citet{Shen_2D_2021} of different total progenitor masses $M$ and densities at the bottom of the helium shell $\rho_5$ (in units of $\mathrm{10^5\,g\,cm^{-3}}$). We obtain the \ion{Si}{2} line properties with the same fitting techniques in Section~\ref{sec:analysis_spec}. We again find that more massive progenitors generally lead to brighter events, but with the same model setups, there is significant scattering due to different viewing angles. In the plot, the cosine value of the polar angle relative to the point of helium detonation, $\mu$, ranges from $+0.93$ (near the helium detonation) to $-0.93$ (opposite to the helium detonation). When the SN is observed along a line of sight closer to the detonation point in the shell (greater $\mu$), it will appear fainter at maximum brightness and show a higher line velocity in \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$6355. We overplot the theoretical $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}$-$v_\mathrm{Si}$ relation of 1D DDet models across a spectrum of progenitor masses in \citet{polin_observational_2019} as the dashed black curve. For a relatively high progenitor mass ($\gtrsim$$1.1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), a high $v_\mathrm{Si}$ ($\gtrsim$$13,500$\,\kms) is predicted. However, with $\mu\lesssim0$, all the 2D models show a lower $v_\mathrm{Si}$ ($\lesssim$$12,000$\,\kms), much closer to \sn\ in the $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}$-$v_\mathrm{Si}$ phase space. Models with $\mu>0$ are more consistent with the predictions in 1D models. It has been argued that the high-velocity SNe\,Ia that generally follow the theoretical $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}$-$v_\mathrm{Si}$ relation of 1D DDet models likely originate from sub-\Mch\ WDs triggered by DDet, while the SNe\,Ia in the clump centered at $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}\simeq-19.5$\,mag and $v_\mathrm{Si}\simeq11,000$\,kms are candidates of near-\Mch\ explosions \citep{polin_observational_2019,Nugent_2023}. However, with multi-dimensional effects taken into account, we would expect a comparable number of high-velocity and normal-velocity SNe\,Ia triggered by DDet. A substantial fraction of the objects within the clump on the $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}$-$v_\mathrm{Si}$ diagram, which has been proposed to consist of mostly near-\Mch\ events, may turn out to be sub-\Mch\ DDet events viewed from certain orientations \citep{Shen_2D_2021}. SN\,2018aoz, the DDet candidate with a suppress in $B$-band flux and excess emission in the infant phase light curve \citep{Ni_2022}, which also lies in the clump in the $M_{B,\mathrm{max}}$-$v_\mathrm{Si}$ space at maximum brightness \citep{Ni_18aoz_2023}, may be another example of DDet SN\,Ia viewed from the hemisphere opposite to where the helium initially detonates.

%SN\,2018aoz shows an early flux excess in $V$ within the first few days since its first light, during which the $B$-band flux is suppressed. The resulting red $B-V$ color is consistent with the predictions of a 1D DDet model with $M_c=1.05\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $M_s=0.01\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Ni_2022}. Near maximum

In the bottom panels of Figure~\ref{fig:model_spec} we show three 2D DDet models with a total progenitor mass of $\sim$$1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ from \citet{Shen_2D_2021}, of which the predicted spectra at peak qualitatively match the observations. The $\rho_5=6$ model has a helium shell of $\sim$0.05$\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We find that when $\mu=0$ (viewed from the equator), the model predicts a reasonable level of line blanketing in the blue side of the spectrum at early times. Near maximum brightness, the model also reproduces the overall shape of the observed spectrum, though overestimating the strengths of almost all absorption lines (4200\,\r{A} features, \ion{S}{2}, and \ion{Si}{2}). The line velocity of \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda$ ($\sim$12,000\,\kms) is also overestimated. When viewed from a hemisphere opposite to the helium detonation point (e.g., $\mu=-0.67$), the model yields an asymmetric profile of 4200\,\r{A} features as a blend of \ion{Ti}{2}, \ion{Fe}{2}, and \ion{Co}{2} lines that matches the observations better. The \ion{Si}{2} features are also predicted to be shallower, though still not as shallow as that in the observations. Nonetheless, the spectra at early times are expected to be much bluer than the observations. The $\rho_5=14$ model has a thicker helium shell ($\sim$0.1\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and produces even shallower and slower-expanding \ion{Si}{2} features at maximum brightness, while the \ion{Ti}{2} absorption is not sufficiently strong. The level of line-blanketing blueward of $\sim$5000\,\r{A} is also underestimated at early times. In addition, all three models ($M_{B,\mathrm{max}}\simeq -19.3$\,mag) are not as bright as \sn. Unfortunately, there are only two models in \citet{Shen_2D_2021} that start from a progenitor more massive than $1\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, both with a thin helium shell ($\lesssim$$0.01\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Thus they cannot reproduce the red color at $\sim$$-12$\,days or the remarkable 4200\,\r{A} features at peak.

We draw the conclusions that the spectroscopic properties of \sn\ are qualitatively consistent with that of a sub-\Mch\ WD ($\gtrsim$1.0\,$\mathrm{M_\odot}$) ignited by a relatively massive ($\sim$0.05$\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) helium shell, viewed from the hemisphere opposite to where the shell detonates. Observers from such a viewing angle would observe strong absorption features in the blue portion of the spectrum dominated by \ion{Ti}{2} and IGEs as well as relatively shallow and slowly-expanding \ion{Si}{2} lines in the red portion. However, none of the individual models can reproduce all the features simultaneously, thus the DDet nature and the progenitor properties are still uncertain. This calls for a larger number of 2D DDet simulations covering a denser grid of model parameters. Dealing with the complications in radiative transfer \citep[e.g., non-LTE effects; see][]{Shen_NLTE_2021} in a more realistic way is also of fundamental importance.

\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:nebular_spec} we compare the two nebular-phase spectra of \sn\ with those of some overluminous SNe\,Ia (SN\,1991T, SN\,1999aa, and SN\,2018cnw) and a normal SN\,Ia (SN\,2011fe), where the flux has been normalized to the [\ion{Fe}{3}] features around 4700\,\r{A}. 

We mainly focus on the complex at $\sim$7300\,\r{A} (here after the 7300\,\r{A} features) that is usually dominated by [\ion{Fe}{2}] and [\ion{Ni}{2}], although in some peculiar SNe\,Ia, [\ion{Ca}{2}] $\lambda\lambda$7291, 7324 emissions are also detected \cite[e.g.,][]{Siebert_2020}. Both spectra of \sn\ show relatively low flux ratio between the 7300\,\r{A} features and the [\ion{Fe}{3}] 4700\,\r{A} features, compared to other SNe\,Ia. This suggests high ionization in the ejecta \citep{Wilk_2020}. The profile of the 7300\,\r{A} features in \sn\ is also distinct from others. Most of SNe\,Ia show a bimodal structure in their 7300\,\r{A} features \citep[e.g.,][]{Graham_2017,Maguire_2018}. The bluer peak is dominated by [\ion{Fe}{2}] $\lambda\lambda$7155, 7172, while [\ion{Ni}{2}] $\lambda\lambda$7378, 7412 usually have non-negligible contributions to the redder peak (see Figure~\ref{fig:nebular_spec}). The bimodal morphology is prominent in the spectra of SN\,1999aa and SN\,2011fe. SN\,1999T is well-known for its broader emission lines in the nebular phase, so the composition of the 7300\,\r{A} features is ambiguous. In the spectra of \sn\ and SN\,2018cnw, however, the redder peak is absent and the 7300\,\r{A} features show an asymmetric single peak, which seems to indicate a low abundance of Ni in the ejecta. 

To investigate the relative contributions of [\ion{Fe}{2}] and [\ion{Ni}{2}] to the 7300\,\r{A} features in \sn, we model this region with multiple Gaussian emission profiles using the same techniques in modeling absorption lines (Section~\ref{sec:analysis_spec}). We include four [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines (7155, 7172, 7388, 7453\,\r{A}) and two [\ion{Ni}{2}] lines (7378, 7412\,\r{A}) in the fit. For each species, the relative flux ratios of lines are fixed, whose values are adopted from \citet{Jerkstrand_2015}. For [\ion{Fe}{2}], we set $L_{7155}:L_{7172}:L_{7388}:L_{7453} = 1:0.24:0.19:0.31$, and for [\ion{Ni}{2}], we set $L_{7378}:L_{7412} = 1:0.31$. These line ratios are calculated assuming LTE, but the departure from LTE should not be significant under the typical conditions in the ejecta \citep{Jerkstrand_2015}. We allow the amplitudes of these Gaussian profiles to be either positive or negative. The velocity dispersions in different lines of each species are set to be the same. The fitted models are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Fe_ni}, where colored curves correspond to the [\ion{Fe}{2}] and [\ion{Ni}{2}] emission adopting the mean values of the posterior distributions of model parameters sampled with MCMC. In both spectra, the flux of [\ion{Ni}{2}] is consistent with 0 (${L_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}}/{L_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}}=0.04\pm0.11$ at $+286$\,days and $0.07\pm0.11$ at $+329$\,days; the flux ratios of lines are estimated with the ratios of their $p$EWs), and the 7300\,\r{A} features can be well fit with [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission only. There is no evidence for [\ion{Ca}{2}] emission either.

The flux ratios of the emission lines can be used to estimate the relative abundance between Ni and Fe, which is a probe of the potential progenitor system. Over one year after the explosion, the dominant isotope of Fe is the stable $^{56}$Fe as the products of $^{56}$Ni through the chain: $^{56}$Ni$\rightarrow^{56}$Co$\rightarrow^{56}$Fe. Consequently, the Fe abundance essentially depends on the yields of $^{56}$Ni, which is similar among different explosion scenarios and progenitor systems as long as the resultant SNe show a maximum brightness. The Ni abundance, however, are sensitive to both progenitor mass and explosion scenario. The stable Ni isotopes ($^{58}$Ni, $^{60}$Ni, and $^{62}$Ni) are more neutron-rich compared to the $\alpha$-species $^{56}$Ni, and can only be formed in high-density regions with a enhanced electron capture rate during the explosion \citep{Nomoto_1984,Khokhlov_1991}. Consequently, SNe\,Ia from sub-\Mch\ WDs, whose central densities are lower than that of near-\Mch\ WDs, are expected to show a lower abundance of stable Ni isotopes \citep{Iwamoto_1999,Seitenzahl_2013,Shen_DD_2018}. 

To estimate the relative abundance of Ni and Fe, we use the equation adopted in \citet{Jerkstrand_2015} and \citet{Maguire_2018},
\begin{equation}
    \frac{L_{7378}}{L_{7155}} = 4.9\frac{n_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}}{n_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}}\exp\left(\frac{0.28\,\mathrm
    {eV}}{k_BT}\right)\frac{dc_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}}{dc_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}},
\end{equation}
where $L_{7378}/L_{7155}$ is the flux ratio of the [\ion{Ni}{2}] $\lambda$7378 to [\ion{Fe}{2}] $\lambda$7155 lines, $n_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}$ ($n_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}$) is the number density of \ion{Ni}{2} (\ion{Fe}{2}), and ${dc_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}}/{dc_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}}$ is the ratio of the departure coefficients from LTE for these two ions. Since both \ion{Ni}{2} and \ion{Fe}{2} are singly ionized species with similar ionization potentials, we assume that $n_{\mathrm{Ni}\,\textsc{ii}}/n_{\mathrm{Fe}\,\textsc{ii}}$ is a good approximation of the total Ni/Fe ratio. As is illustrated in \citet{Maguire_2018}, this assumption proves to be valid by modeling nebular phase spectra at similar phases \citep{Fransson_2015,Shingles_2022}, with the relative deviation from the ionization balance $\lesssim$20\%. We handle the uncertainties due to the unknown temperature, ratio of departure coefficients, and the ionization balance in a Monte Carlo way. We randomly generate $N=4000$ samples of the temperature (3000--8000\,K), the ratio of departure coefficients (1.2--2.4), and the ionization balance factor (0.8--1.2) assuming uncorrelated uniform distributions. These intervals are again adopted from \citet{Maguire_2018}. Combining these quantities with the samples of line profile parameters drawn with the MCMC, we obtain $N$ estimates of Ni/Fe, which are effectively drawn from its posterior distribution. The mean value of Ni/Fe is $\sim$0.004, and a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\sim$0.026 is placed. Such a low Ni abundance is more consistent with the yields of sub-\Mch\ DDet scenarios \citep{Shen_DD_2018}, much lower than the expected outcomes of near-\Mch, delayed detonation models \citep{Seitenzahl_2013} or pure deflagration models \citep{Iwamoto_1999}.

We also find that the [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines are significantly blueshifted ($v_\mathrm{[Fe\,\textsc{ii}]}=-2.36\pm0.35\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ at $+286$\,days and $-1.52\pm0.51\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ at $+329$\,days). This is consistent with other SNe\,Ia showing low $v_\mathrm{Si}$ at maximum brightness \citep{Maeda_2010,Maguire_2018,Li_2021}, and also in qualitative agreement with the asymmetric sub-\Mch\ DDet scenarios. Specifically, along a line of sight opposite to the shell detonation point, observers would see intermediate mass elements (IMEs) with low expansion velocities, including \ion{Si}{2}. In the meantime, the IGEs at the center of the ejecta would have a bulk velocity towards the observer \citep{Fink_DD_2010,Bulla_2016}.
